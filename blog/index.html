  <h1 class="page-heading">About Me</h1>

  Hi! My name is Samantha Bobra.

I’ve been a software engineer at Visual Supply Co. for the past two years. I spent most of this time working on Android version of VSCO® and now work on the Growth team. From New Jersey originally, I graduated from Cornell University with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2013. After briefly working on a gaming startup, I ended up out here in beautiful San Francisco, CA. In my free time, I enjoy film, photography, video games, and reading too much on the internet.

Find me on social media, or say hi at sam.bobra@gmail!
